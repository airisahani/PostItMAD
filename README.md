In the initial commit, i've created:



MainActivity.java page which has the bottom navigator.    
Each button in the bottomNavigator is functional. When each of them is clicked, you will be directed to each individual fragments which are:


- HomeFragment
- HistoryFragment
- AddReportActivity
- MapFragment
- AccountFragment
  
TODO:
- Add your own respective parts in the pages.
- you can change whether to use intent of fragment
